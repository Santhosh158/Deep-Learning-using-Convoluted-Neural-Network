**Google Images Data**  
Kaggle dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/duttadebadri/image-classification  


The dataset consists of scraped images from google which are split into four different categories as below  
* Architecture  
* Art and culture  
* Food and Drinks  
* Travel and culture  

- Here, we are building a model to classify the images into one of the categories - 'architecture' and 'art and culture'.  
- The images varies with color, diversity, structure, people and various other attributes. We could find more images with people in 'Art and culture' category compared to 'Architecture' which consists of buildings and structures.
